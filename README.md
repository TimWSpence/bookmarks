# Bookmarks

A Haskell rewrite of [bookmarks.rb](https://github.com/TimWSpence/bookmarks.rb)

### Why a rewrite?

Because Haskell :) But also because building a binary with Stack is much
easier and more reliable than trying to set ruby up to `bundle exec` with the right Ruby/Gem
versions. Mine own installation of `bookmarks.rb` has broken on numerous occasions
when installing/changing system Ruby versions, etc
